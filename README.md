# Indian-Crime-Data-Visualization  & Reporting for IT
A Tableau-based data visualization project analyzing crime trends across Indian cities using the Indian Crimes Dataset. Includes planning, decision-making, and dashboard implementation phases.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **crime trends across multiple Indian cities** using the *Indian Crimes Dataset (Kaggle)*.  
The work was completed in three phases â€” **Planning**, **Decision Making**, and **Dashboard Implementation** â€” culminating in an interactive Tableau dashboard for law enforcement, crime analysts, and policymakers.

## Phase I â€“ Planning
- Defined dataset scope and data attributes (categorical, ratio, interval, ordinal).  
- Identified primary dashboard users: law enforcement, crime analysts, administrators, and city planners.  
- Established analytical questions such as:
  - What are the most frequent crime types?
  - How do crime rates vary by city, time, and weapon type?
  - How does police deployment correlate with crime rates?
- Dataset Source: [Indian Crimes Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanvahg/indian-crimes-dataset)


## Phase II â€“ Decision Making
- Selected **Tableau** as the primary visualization tool due to scalability and interactive features.  
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**, including handling missing values, separating date/time fields, and normalization.  
- Designed visualizations such as:
  - Bar chart â€“ Top 5 crime types  
  - Map â€“ Geographic crime distribution  
  - Line chart â€“ Monthly trends  
  - Stacked bar â€“ Crimes by day/time  
  - Donut chart â€“ Weapon use in violent crimes  
- Developed interactive filters for date range, city, gender, crime type, and case status.


## Phase III â€“ Dashboard Implementation
- Built the **India Crime Data Analysis Dashboard** in Tableau.  
- Integrated interactive filters, tooltips, and dynamic visuals for in-depth exploration.  
- Visualized:
  - Crime hotspots across Indian cities  
  - Victim demographics by gender and age  
  - Police deployment correlation with crime rates  
  - Case closure rates by crime type  
  - Temporal trends across days and months  
- Enhanced interactivity through parameter controls and custom tooltips.

Key Insights
- Identified high-crime areas and times of day with peak incidents.  
- Discovered correlations between police deployment and crime reduction.  
- Highlighted weapon usage patterns and victim demographics.  
- Provided actionable data-driven insights for safety policy and planning.


## Tools Used:
- **Tableau** â€“ Dashboard and visualization  
- **Excel / Python (Pandas)** â€“ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Kaggle Dataset** â€“ Source for raw crime data
